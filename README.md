  <h1 align="center">Gatsby Workshop</h1>
  <p>
    This workshop covers the fundamentals of developing fast, accessible sites with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React framework, and dive deep into the building blocks you’ll need to build your own custom Gatsby sites.
    
   After completing a mix of lectures and exercises you’ll be able to build a Gatsby site from the ground up and deploy it live. In particular, you’ll learn the ins and outs of creating Gatsby sites, from selecting a starter or theme, using GraphQL to generate the data layer, making Markdown content interactive with MDX, deploying your site, and more!

## Prerequisites

- This workshop is for JavaScript developers who haven't had extensive experience with Gatsby and want a deeper understanding of Gatsby.

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v12 or greater
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/m0nica/gatsby-workshop.git
npm install
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. You can also open the production deployment: LINK TBD

## Running the tests

TBD

### Exercises

The exercises are in different branches. Each branch changes the
`INSTRUCTIONS.md` file to contain instructions you need to complete the
exercise.

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.

### Workflow

- Checkout the exercise branch
- Read through the `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Start exercise
- Go through every mentioned file and follow the instructions
- We all come back together
- I go through the solution and answer questions
- Move on to the next exercise.
- Repeat.
