# 07 â€¢ Render Speaker/Talk Data Type

## Background ðŸ“š

As we've seen in earlier exercises `data` from GraphQL static queries can be used as `props` in components to render data. Now that we have speaker data available in GraphQL we can use that data throughout the application.

The speaker data in this application in yaml is structure liked:

```
- name: "Angela Toad"
  title: "Introduction to Sketching Animals"
  time: "12:00"
  avatar: "woman-generated-avatar-1.png"

- name: "Larry Foam"
  title: "Getting Started with Sketchnoting"
  time: "10:00"
  avatar: "man-generated-avatar-1.png"
```

and returns data in this shape from GraphQL

```
{
"data": {
  "allSpeakersYaml": {
    "edges": [
      {
        "node": {
          "id": "d1251971-3091-5906-a241-e66474a66273",
          "avatar": "woman-generated-avatar-1.png",
          "name": "Angela Toad",
          "title": "Introduction to Sketching Animals",
          "time": "12:00"
        }
      },
      {
        "node": {
          "id": "79791060-9578-5381-b772-4678f8e833f6",
          "avatar": "man-generated-avatar-1.png",
          "name": "Larry Foam",
          "title": "Getting Started with Sketchnoting",
          "time": "10:00"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
},
}
```
