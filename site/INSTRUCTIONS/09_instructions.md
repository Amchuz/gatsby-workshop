# 09 â€¢ Link to Speaker Pages

## Background ðŸ“š

In the previous exercise we programmatically created speaker/tlak pages where each speaker/talk had a slug generated and added to GraphQL. Now that we have that data let's update the `talkCards` to `Link` to the appropriate place.



## Exercise ðŸ¤“

- Update the `talkCard` component to link to the slug for a given talk. 


## Files ðŸ—‚

- `site/src/components/talkCard.js`
- `site/src/pages/index.js`
